### Overview

There are several review articles, chapters, and books on program evaluation. Broadly defined representative examples include: Abadie and Cattaneo (2018), Angrist and Pischke (2009), Heckman and Vytlacil (2007), Imbens and Rubin (2015), Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), and Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell (2016), among many others. For RD methodology and empirical practice, we will employ the following background references: Cattaneo, Titiunik, and Vazquez-Bare (2017), Cattaneo, Idrobo, and Titiunik (2018a,b), and Cattaneo and Titiunik (2018).
